## User Story #1 - Proximity Chat

As a player who cannot/does not want to rely on visual/auditory content, I need to be able to textually chat with nearby players (nearby meaning players nearby in the virtual room) so that I am still able to communicate and interact with those around me. To do this, I would:

- Press the messages button in the top right corner of the screen
- View the expanded chat sidebar
- Click the Proximity Chat tab
- Scroll through messages in proximity chat
- Send a message to nearby players using the input and button at the bottom of the screen
  -Move around to locations near other players using arrow keys to change who you receive messages from/send messages to

## User Story #2 - Town Chat

As a player who wants to host a group event, I need to be able to notify everyone in the town of announcements regardless of their location in the town. I also want to be able to have a place where all the players in the room can speak to each other in a general chat even if they are not in close proximity in the town. To do this, I would:

- Press the messages button in the top right corner of the screen
- View the expanded chat sidebar
- Click the Town Chat tab
- You should see all messages sent in the Town Chat since you joined the town
- Send a message to all players in the town using the input button at the bottom of the screen

## User Story #3 - Direct Messages

As a player who wishes to build individual friendships, I want to be able to direct message other players in the town that I am in, so that we can have more extensive conversations away from the potentially chaotic announcement/proximity chats, as well as maintaining our privacy from other players. To do this, I would:

- Press the messages button in the top right corner of the screen
- View the expanded chat sidebar the chat bar automatically defaults to Direct Messages
- Click ‘Continue Chat’ with a player you have an existing chat with OR Click ‘Start Chat’ with a new player
- You should see all the messages sent between you and a player OR a blank chat history with a new chat
- Send a message to the one player using the input button at the bottom of the screen
- If the player you are chatting with disconnects the input will be disabled and the text placeholder will display ‘You can no longer message with this player, as they have disconnected’
